End Questions:
1. How would you define Machine Learning? (CORRECT)
Personal Answer: Using data to create an algorithm that allows a machine/program to generalize its processes based on previously learned experiences from data. 
Book Answer: Machine Learning is about building sytems that can learn from data. Learning means getting better at some task, given some performance measure.

2. Can you name four types of problems where it shines? (MOSTLY CORRECT)
Personal Answer: 
  - Problems that require constant maintenance or a large list of rules, which can be simplified by a machine learning program
  - Complex problems that have a variety of solutions
  - Generating insights on large sets of data
  - Can't remember
Book Answer: Machine Learning is great for
  - Complex problems for which we have no algorithmic solution,
  - To replace long lists of hand-tuned rules
  - To build systems that adapt to fluctuating evironments
  - To help humans learn (eg data mining)

3. What is a labeled training set? (WRONG)
Personal Answer: A set of data used partly to train the machine learning program, to test the program and to validate the results of that test. 
Book Answer: A training set that contains the desired solution (a label) for each instance. 

4. What are the two most common supervised tasks?
Personal Answer: 
  - Supervised learning
  - Reinforcement learning
Book Answer:

5. Can you name four common unsupervised tasks?
Personal Answer:
Book Answer:

6. What type of Machine Learning algorithm would you use to allow a robot to walk in various unknown terrains?
Personal Answer: Reinforcement learning
Book Answer:

7. What type of algorithm would you use to segment your customers into multiple groups?
Personal Answer: Clustering
Book Answer:

8. Would you frame the problem of spam detection as a supervised learning problem or an unsupervised learning problem?
Personal Answer: Unsupervised learning problem
Book Answer:

9. What is an online learning system?
Personal Answer: A system that connects to an online database to constantly relearn material depending on experiences. Its fast and doesn't require update but takes a lot of data.
Book Answer:

10. What is out-of-core learning?
Personal Answer: A system that learns from a large dataset being imported into the process that can be used offline. Uses less machine power and is less demanding but can run into problems and requires updates. 
Book Answer:

11. What type of learning algorithm relies on a similarity measure to make predictions?
Personal Answer:
Book Answer:

12. What is the difference between a model parameter and a learning algorithms hyperparameter?
Personal Answer:
Book Answer:

13. What do model-based learning algorithms search for? What is the most common strategy they use to succeed? How do they make predictions?
Personal Answer:
Book Answer:

14. Can you name four of the main challenges in Machine Learning?
Personal Answer: Overfitting, underfitting, sampling noise, and sampling bias. 
Book Answer:

15. If your model performs great on the training data but generalizes poorly to new instances, what is happening? Can you name three possible solutions?
Personal Answer: The model is overfitting to the training data and does not have room to generalize to new data that might differ from training data. Solutions:
  - Manipulate the models variables 
  - Increase training data variability
  - Use a test set 
Book Answer:

16. What is a test set and why would you want to use it?
Personal Answer: Typically 20% of the data with the other 80 being used for training. It is used to verify that the model is not being over or underfit to the training data.
Book Answer:

17. What is the purpose of a validation set?
Personal Answer: To verify that the training and test sets functioned as they were supposed to and see whether the program is ready for outside use. 
Book Answer:

18. What can go wrong if you tune hyperparameters using the test set?
Personal Answer:
Book Answer:

19. What is cross-validation and why would you prefer it to a validation set?
Personal Answer:
Book Answer:

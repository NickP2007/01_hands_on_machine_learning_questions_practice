End Questions:
1. How would you define Machine Learning? (CORRECT)
Personal Answer: Using data to create an algorithm that allows a machine/program to generalize its processes based on previously learned experiences from data. 
Book Answer: Machine Learning is about building sytems that can learn from data. Learning means getting better at some task, given some performance measure.

2. Can you name four types of problems where it shines? (MOSTLY CORRECT)
Personal Answer: 
  - Problems that require constant maintenance or a large list of rules, which can be simplified by a machine learning program
  - Complex problems that have a variety of solutions
  - Generating insights on large sets of data
  - Can't remember
Book Answer: Machine Learning is great for
  - Complex problems for which we have no algorithmic solution,
  - To replace long lists of hand-tuned rules
  - To build systems that adapt to fluctuating evironments
  - To help humans learn (eg data mining)

3. What is a labeled training set? (WRONG)
Personal Answer: A set of data used partly to train the machine learning program, to test the program and to validate the results of that test. 
Book Answer: A training set that contains the desired solution (a label) for each instance.
